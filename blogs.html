        <h2>What is neog camp ?</h2>
        <p>Neog camp is a 4-month web development bootcamp. The structure of this camp is divided into two parts.<br><br>i)level zero<br>i)level one<br><br> Students will be selected to level one based on their performance in level zero. The fun part about camp is that here we learn concepts by building things contrary to the traditional way of learning things and trying to build things on top of that knowledge. I realized that this way of learning is very powerful and Tanay is doing an awesome job. For more details <a href="https://neog.camp/">check here</a></p>
