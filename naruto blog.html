        <p>Itachi without a doubt is the most elegant and loved character of Naruto anime. As the one person Sasuke which is his own brother wanted to kill since the beginning of the series, Itachi was immediately painted as the cold-blooded villain who slaughtered his own clan. He was dark and mysterious, and yet, he still managed to touch our hearts when the whole truth came out about his motives.<br><br>Because of the rising tension between the Uchiha Clan and the village, Itachi attempted to settle the matter peacefully, but when that didn't work, he chose to side with the village by killing his own clan. That was the only way Itachi could spare the life of his little brother, Sasuke, whom he could never bring himself to kill.<br><br> Classifying him as one of anime's most famous characters would not be an overstatement.
