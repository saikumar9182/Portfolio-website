            <p>Neog camp is a 4-month web development bootcamp. The structure of this camp is divided into two parts.<br><br>i)level zero<br>i)level one<br><br> As part of level zero students have to do 15 projects which are fun to do and have to host them on any hosting platform. Students will be selected to level one based on their performance in interview which involves a live coding round and also explanation of the code of any random project that is being done in level zero. The fun part about camp is that here we learn concepts by building things contrary to the traditional way of learning things and trying to build things on top of that knowledge.  This way of learning is very powerful and Tanay is doing an awesome job. <br><br>
                
                The first batch of neog has brought out some awesome developers having them placed in top companies like unacademy. The camp gives it's students some best benefits which other web dev bootcamps may not give. One such benefit is Guest lectures from top industry professionals like Kushal Gour. The whole camp students are very motivated which makes every one to strive hard to catch on. For more details about the camp <a href="https://neog.camp/">check here</a></p>
